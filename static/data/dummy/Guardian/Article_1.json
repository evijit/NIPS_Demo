When I was suffering from serious depression, the whole season became a tormenting joke, my own misery highlighted by the contrast with the jollity of my surroundings.

It helped as a marker of progress, since it was always easier to remember Christmases in a way that you can\u2019t remember, say, Octobers.",

Because, ever since 1843, when Dickens published A Christmas Carol, there has been a new kind of Christmas, a parallel Christmas that defined it as a feeling, rather than a date or a biblical narrative. Pinning down that feeling is hard, since it is a magical feeling, and magic can\u2019t be explained. It is \u2013 as Dickens\u2019s Scrooge suggests when he says: \u201cI will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year\u201d \u2013 beyond the season itself.",

Only ET had had such a profound, positive psychological effect on me. The scene near the end in which Scrooge dresses up as Father Christmas and delivers turkey and toys to the Cratchits worked on me like a kind of emotional central heating; the song Thank You Very Much was so unabashedly happy and sentimental that it reminded me of the child I was. It was one of the most moving experiences of my life and \u2013 don\u2019t laugh \u2013 I think it made me a better person.

I loved it, because it was very immersive \u2013 and I got to dance on stage with Brenda Blethyn \u2013 but it was in books that I found the most Christmas magic. Not only A Christmas Carol, which I finally read when I was about 12, but also in tales such as The Snowman, Susan Cooper\u2019s The Dark is Rising sequence and Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Little Match Girl. All have a darkness to them, as do all the great Christmas stories. In The Little Match Girl, the saddest of all Christmas tales, a poor, homeless girl lights matches to keep herself warm and sees visions of Christmas in the flame.

It\u2019s live, the actors are there in front of you - it doesn\u2019t involve a phone or a computer. As a little girl, I adored Cinderella, and I remember seeing this girl\u2019s rags transform into the most glamorous dress. Being practically minded, though, I was always conscious of her glass slippers and thought that they must be really uncomfortable. Christmas is always a precious time when my rather small family gets together, and what is lovely is that it is just the four of us. The boys, who are 33 and 29, still expect pillowcases as stockings, although they have become incredibly good cooks and so often take over from me. We always take the dogs for a walk and then we flop in front of the telly. Morecambe and Wise used to dominate Christmas when I was younger, but now we watch whatever is good \u2013 or bad.

And what better than Bach to clear the palate? The disciplined notes, the soaring, perfect structure of the music reminds us what this season is all about: kindness to others and healing. So, a firm date in my Christmas diary is the annual performance by Ludus Baroque of Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio. Ludus Baroque is one of the finest chamber orchestras and choirs in the UK and is conducted by a friend, Richard Neville-Towle, who gathers the best baroque singers and instrumentalists and brings them to Canongate church in Edinburgh. It is a perfect setting for Bach: steeped in history, beautiful in the simple, unpretentious way of Scottish architecture of the time. Bach sounds perfect there, and at the end we will go out into the night, perhaps reminding ourselves that the following day, the winter solstice, things get lighter \u2013 and better, we hope.",
