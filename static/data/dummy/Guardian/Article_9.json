No. The bird\u2019s head bobbing forward and back, the wambly neck, the bewildered rider, slightly out of control, legs a-flap like extra wings\u2026 Like daft dogs on You\u2019ve Been Framed, a human in an ostrich suit is never not funny. Even thinking about it makes me laugh."

Suddenly her ostrich isn\u2019t just hilarious \u2013 it\u2019s perilous, too. Smashing on to concrete from higher than 6ft is very different from tripping in your heels. The stilts transform Rose\u2019s act into hardcore funny-ing; they show a talent far greater than taking one in the face with a custard pie. Stilts are circus skills; Rose knows what she\u2019s doing."

Dressing up and mucking about in front of a passing, unplanned, penny-chucking audience has been going on in Britain for hundreds of years, with rituals shared through time, tweaked for the contemporary, but reaching back to Shakespeare."

If she and her compadres weren\u2019t bothering to travel from festival to fair to trot about on stilts dressed like silly birds, then the only outside entertainment would be Kanye or Coldplay. And no matter how muddy, those festivals would be dry dry dry."
